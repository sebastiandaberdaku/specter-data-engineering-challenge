## Please provide answers to the following questions, a couple paragraphs for each question will suffice.

### Question 1
We run scrapes continuously, both on the same websites as data changes over time and on new websites that we find 
interesting. How would you monitor the activity of the scrapers to make sure they were functioning and functioning 
correctly?

### Answer
Scrape runs can be scheduled with tools such as Airflow, Dagster, Prefect etc., or cloud-based workflow orchestrators 
such as AWS Step Functions, all of which provide monitoring capabilities at the task level. Detailed logging would be 
essential, capturing key operation logs, errors, and performance metrics to ensure the scrapers are functioning 
correctly. Real-time notifications should be implemented, either through dedicated dashboards or via tools like 
PagerDuty or Slack, to alert the operations team of any issues promptly.

For performance monitoring, I would collect metrics such as resource utilisation using tools like Prometheus or 
OpenTelemetry. These metrics could then be visualised with tools like Grafana or Datadog, providing insights into 
scraper performance over time. Implementing robust error handling with retry mechanisms enables scrapers to recover from 
minor disruptions, minimising downtime and ensuring data collection continuity.

In terms of data quality, I would implement specific checks at critical points in the data processing pipelines. These 
checks would validate the correctness of the results and detect errors early on, enhancing the overall data quality. 
Additionally, I would conduct periodic sanity checks on intermediate and final datasets using dedicated pipelines. These 
pipelines would run independently of the scrapers and focus solely on validating the collected data, providing an extra 
layer of assurance.

Lastly, I would prioritise automated testing and regular maintenance to adapt to changes in the target websites. This 
proactive approach would help identify and address potential issues before they impact scraper performance or data 
quality, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the scraping process in the long run.

### Question 2
We join data from lots of sources, and this can lead to sparsity in the data, often it’s a case of identifying when we 
are missing data and differentiating that from when data simply isn’t available. How could you determine missing data 
in a scalable way?

### Answer
To ensure robust handling of missing data in large-scale data processing, I would integrate comprehensive data 
quality frameworks and lineage tracking into the data management strategy. Data quality frameworks such as Great 
Expectations offer sophisticated tools for assessing and maintaining data integrity at scale. This is achieved by 
employing declarative expectations in terms of assertions about what the data should look like, and data profiling 
collection on statistics, distributions, schemas, etc., all being automated inside the actual ETL pipelines.

These frameworks facilitate automated validation checks, allowing for the detection of missing values, outliers, 
and inconsistencies across diverse datasets. By establishing predefined rules and expectations, it is possible to  
systematically identify missing data while distinguishing it from unavailable data, ensuring high data quality 
throughout the processing pipeline.

Keeping track of data lineage enables users to understand its origin, structure, and completeness. Lineage management 
further enhances the transparency and traceability of data by capturing the lifecycle of datasets from source to 
destination. Tools like Databricks and OpenMetadata provide capabilities for tracking data lineage, documenting data 
transformations, and visualising data flows. By capturing the lineage of data, it is possible to trace the source of 
missing values from the originating downstream processes, and to implement corrective measures as needed. This holistic 
approach to data management ensures that missing data is accurately identified, documented, and addressed within the 
broader context of data quality and governance.

### Question 3
We release data on a weekly cadence, as time goes on, we query more data, and it can take longer to scrape and process 
the data we need. How would you scale the system to do more work within a shorter period of time?

### Answer
In general, it is safe to assume that scraping can be performed on different websites independently and in parallel. 
To achieve this, a multi-faceted approach can be adopted, starting with parallelisation and distributed computing. 
By leveraging frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask, tasks can be distributed across multiple nodes or machines, enabling 
concurrent execution of scraping and processing tasks. This parallel processing capability significantly reduces the 
overall processing time, allowing the system to cope with larger datasets efficiently.

Horizontal scaling is another crucial strategy for accommodating increased workloads. By adding more resources, such as 
additional servers or instances, the system's capacity to process data in parallel can be expanded. This approach not 
only increases throughput but also enhances system resilience by distributing workloads across multiple nodes. 

Implementing incremental data processing techniques can also contribute to faster execution times. By processing only 
the incremental changes since the last execution, the system can reduce the amount of data processed, leading to more 
efficient resource utilisation. Moreover, efficient resource allocation and management are paramount. Dynamic resource 
scaling, such as auto-scaling provided by cloud providers, ensures optimal resource utilisation based on workload 
demands, enabling the system to adapt to changing data volumes effectively.

The destination databases should also be scaled accordingly, employing sharding and data partitioning to enable multiple
parallel writes. 

### Question 4
A recent change to the codebase has caused a feature to begin failing, the failure has made its way to production and 
needs to be resolved. What would you do to get the system back on track and reduce these sorts of incidents happening 
in the future?

### Answer
When faced with a feature failure that has made its way to production, my immediate focus would be on resolving the 
issue promptly to minimise any disruption to users and mitigate any potential negative impact on the system's 
functionality. This involves identifying the root cause of the failure through thorough debugging and analysis of the 
recent code changes. I would prioritise communication with the development team to understand the nature of the change 
that led to the failure and collaborate on implementing a fix. Depending on the severity of the issue, I may consider 
rolling back the recent changes temporarily to restore the affected feature's functionality while a permanent solution 
is devised. A blue-green type of deployment could ease the rollback process.

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, I would advocate for the implementation of robust testing and 
quality assurance practices within the development lifecycle. This includes conducting comprehensive unit tests, 
integration tests, and regression tests to ensure that code changes do not introduce unintended consequences or 
regressions. Additionally, I would encourage the adoption of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) 
practices to automate testing and deployment processes, allowing for early detection of issues before they reach 
production. Regular code reviews and peer inspections can also help identify potential issues and ensure adherence to 
best practices and coding standards. 

A multienvironment approach to software development would also help mitigate such
issues. Software artefacts with new features would require a thorough testing phase on a production-like staging 
environment before being promoted to the actual production one. Correctly tagging and versioning of these artefacts is
also useful in case of rollbacks.

Finally, I would emphasise the importance of maintaining a culture of transparency, accountability, and continuous 
improvement within the development team. Encouraging open communication channels and post-incident reviews (PIRs) can 
facilitate learning from failures and mistakes, leading to the implementation of preventive measures and the adoption 
of corrective actions to avoid similar incidents in the future. By fostering a culture of resilience and learning, the 
team can effectively mitigate risks and ensure the stability and reliability of the system over time.
